Youtube Simulator Z Inf SD script

Features:

Infinite SD

How this works:
If you want this to be your video, it requires the Internet Stick to earn money. If your wondering why you need a Internet stick, cause Inter Sticks can provide more SD which has the Lightning logo and it is used for extra SD.
